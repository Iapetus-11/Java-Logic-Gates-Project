# Java-Logic-Gates-Project
I'm going to try and code either a virtual binary calculator of sorts, or a virtual 8 bit cpu using Java. I may add a gui in the future, but for now there will be no input, all the variables will be hardcoded for now.

## TODO:
* Add more logic gates to the logic class if needed.
* Add a class for stuff like shift registers.
* Add a class for the actual putting together of stuff.
* Not have a mental breakdown.
