# Java-Logic-Gates-Project
* I'm going to try and code either a virtual binary calculator of sorts, and/or a 8 bit cpu--probably a virtual replica of an Intel 8080.

## TODO:
* Add more logic gates to the logic class if needed.
* Add a class for stuff like shift registers.
* Add a class for the actual putting together of stuff.
* Not have a mental breakdown.
