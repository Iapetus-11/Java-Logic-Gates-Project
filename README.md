# Java-Logic-Gates-Project
* I'm going to try and code a virtual binary calculator of sorts, and/or a 8 bit cpu--probably a virtual replica of an Intel 8080.

## TODO:
* Add a method in Calculator for multiplication
* Add a method in Calculator for division
* Not have a mental breakdown
### Longterm:
* Add more logic gates to the logic class if needed for cpu
* Add a class for stuff like shift registers if needed for cpu
* Add a cpu class w/ virtual cpu
